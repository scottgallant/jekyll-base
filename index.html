  <h1>Level One Heading</h1>
  <h2>Level Two Heading</h2>
  <h3>Level Three Heading</h3>
  <h4>Level Four Heading</h4>
  <h5>Level Five Heading</h5>
  <h6>Level Six Heading</h6>

  <p>This is a standard paragraph created using the WordPress TinyMCE text editor. It has a <strong>strong tag</strong>, an <em>em tag</em> and a <del>strikethrough</del> which is actually just the del element. There are a few more inline elements which are not in the WordPress admin but we should check for incase your users get busy with the copy and paste. These include <cite>citations</cite>, <abbr title="abbreviation">abbr</abbr>, bits of <code>code</code> and <var>variables</var>, <q>inline quotations</q>, <ins datetime="2011-12-08T20:19:53+00:00">inserted text</ins>, text that is <s>no longer accurate</s> or something <mark>so important</mark> you might want to mark it. We can also style subscript and superscript characters like C0<sub>2</sub>, here is our 2<sup>nd</sup> example. If they are feeling non-semantic they might even use <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <big>big</big> or <small>small</small> elements too.&nbsp;Incidentally, these HTML4.01 tags have been given new life and semantic meaning in HTML5, you may be interested in reading this <a title="HTML5 Semantics" href="http://csswizardry.com/2011/01/html5-and-text-level-semantics">article by Harry Roberts</a> which gives a nice excuse to test a link.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also worth noting in the "kitchen sink" view you can also add <span style="text-decoration: underline;">underline</span>.</p>
